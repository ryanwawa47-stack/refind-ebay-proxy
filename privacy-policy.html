ReFind Privacy Policy

Effective date: February 25, 2026

ReFind (“we,” “our,” or “us”) provides a browser extension that helps users find alternative product listings while shopping online.

1. Information We Process
ReFind processes limited browsing-context information needed to provide its core feature:

The current page title (for example, a product name)
The search query derived from that title
Basic request metadata needed to operate our API (such as timestamps and technical logs)
ReFind does not intentionally collect sensitive personal information.

2. How We Use Information
We use processed information only to:

Generate relevant alternative product results
Return those results to the extension popup
Maintain service reliability, security, and abuse prevention
3. Data Sharing
We do not sell personal data.

To provide results, ReFind sends query data to our backend service, which requests listing data from third-party marketplace APIs (for example, eBay APIs). Data is used only to fulfill user requests.

4. Data Retention
We retain operational logs only as long as necessary for debugging, security, and performance monitoring, then delete or anonymize them according to our internal retention practices.

5. User Controls
Users can stop all data processing by:

Disabling or uninstalling the extension
Not using the ReFind popup/button
6. Security
We use reasonable technical measures to protect data in transit and at rest. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

7. Children’s Privacy
ReFind is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Effective date” above will reflect the latest version.
